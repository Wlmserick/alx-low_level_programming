These are generally most important options for normal use on your VM and in your assignment Makefiles. You’ll probably end up knowing them by heart.

-Wall show all warnings. It turns on all standard C++ warnings about code that might cause unexpected or undefined behavior.
-g provides debugging feature for your program. You will need this when you want to use gdb or valgrind.
--std=c++<##> uses version <##> of C++ when compiling. This will allow you to use specific features of that C++ version. Typically, we have you use --std=c++17.
-o <filename> compiles and links files into an executable named <filename>. The default filename is a.out.
-c compiles and assembles files but doesn’t link them. This is useful when building large projects to separate file compilation and minimize what is re-compiled
