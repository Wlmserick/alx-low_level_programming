Sure, here is a GCC cheat sheet:

* **-Wall:** Enable all warnings.
* **-Werror:** Treat all warnings as errors.
* **-pedantic:** Enable extra warnings, such as those for undefined behavior.
* **-Wextra:** Enable additional warnings beyond -Wall.
* **-std=c99:** Use the C99 standard.
* **-O3:** Optimize for speed.
* **-g:** Generate debugging symbols.
* **-c:** Only compile the source code, do not link.
* **-o filename:** Compile the source code and output the executable file to filename.
* **-I directory:** Add directory to the list of directories to search for header files.
* **-L directory:** Add directory to the list of directories to search for libraries.
* **-l library:** Link against library.

For more information, please see the GCC documentation: https://gcc.gnu.org/

Here are some additional tips:

* Use `-Wall` and `-Werror` to catch as many potential errors as possible.
* Use `-pedantic` to enable extra warnings that can catch subtle errors.
* Use `-std=c99` to ensure that your code is compatible with the C99 standard.
* Use `-O3` to optimize your code for speed, but be aware that this can sometimes introduce errors.
* Use `-g` to generate debugging symbols so that you can debug your code if it doesn't work correctly.
* Use `-c` to only compile the source code, do not link. This can be useful if you want to check your code for errors before linking it with a library.
* Use `-o filename` to compile the source code and output the executable file to filename.
* Use `-I directory` to add directory to the list of directories to search for header files. This can be useful if you are using headers from a third-party library.
* Use `-L directory` to add directory to the list of directories to search for libraries. This can be useful if you are linking against a third-party library.
* Use `-l library` to link against library. This can be used to link against a third-party library
